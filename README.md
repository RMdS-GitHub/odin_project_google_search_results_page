# odin_project_google_search_results_page

This is the assignment for "The Odin Project" on the Web Development 101 path, "Project: Google Homepage".
Before this I finish the "Responsive Certification" from "Free Code Camp" as suggested.

I will not made this webpage responsive for every device.
Here's the description of the assignement:

Difficult Version (optional): Build the Google.com search results page

You should be able to reuse much of your code from before if you started with that project. Again, don’t worry about links to nowhere and forms that won’t submit and hard coding the search results (which you’ll have to do of course), just focus on placement and order of items on the page.

Note: All the classes and id’s and names of elements that you inspect on Google’s home page are nonsensical strings (like <div class='srg'>). This is because the code was Minified (see the Wikipedia entry here), which removes or shortens unnecessary characters and names to help the page load faster. The HTML (or JavaScript or CSS) file will be smaller but the browser can still read it just fine.
